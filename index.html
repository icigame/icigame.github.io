    <p>Welcome to ICI game. The winner will receive [PUT THE REWARD HERE]. You may work together with a group of people, or go alone. However, because of the difficulty of this game I recommend working in a group.</p>
    <br/>
    <p>Many things will be required to complete this game. For example, basic image editing, viewing the source code (remember, inspect element is blocked, but view page source is not!), and codebreaking. It may seem daunting, but there will be plenty of hints if you know where to look.</p>
    <br/>
    <p>The answer to each challenge will be a single word. You will enter the answer by putting it at the end of the url, after a slash.</p>
    <p>For example, if the answer to a challenge were to be 'strengthen' you would put 'icigame.github.io/strengthen' into the url bar.</p>
    <br/>
    <p>I highly recommend that when you solve a challenge, you bookmark the solution so that you don't forget the word.</p>
